# 🧠 DeepSeek-V3: From-Scratch Reimplementation

A complete from-scratch implementation of **DeepSeek V3**, a powerful transformer-based language model architecture. This project incorporates multiple state-of-the-art techniques for efficient, scalable, and high-performing large language models (LLMs).

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 🔹 Multi-Layer Attention  
Hierarchical attention routing across multiple layers for improved long-range context understanding and deeper representation learning.

### 🔹 Gated Attention Unit (GATE)  
Selective gating of information before attention is applied. Inspired by DeepSeek’s optimization to reduce redundant computation while preserving essential context.

### 🔹 Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)  
Enhances extrapolation ability for longer sequences by encoding relative positions directly into the attention mechanism.

### 🔹 Grouped Query Attention (GQA)  
Reduces computation by sharing key-value pairs across grouped queries, maintaining expressiveness with fewer parameters.

### 🔹 DeepNorm Initialization  
Enables training of deep transformer stacks by applying carefully scaled weight initialization, significantly improving training stability.

### 🔹 Mixture of Experts (MoE)  
Integrates sparse expert routing to increase model capacity without linear growth in compute. Efficient expert parallelism built in.

### 🔹 FlashAttention 2  
Integrated for high-speed, memory-efficient attention computation on modern GPUs. Essential for training with long context sizes.

### 🔹 Tokenizer & Output Heads  
Customized tokenizer pipeline and configurable output heads for various NLP tasks. Aligns with DeepSeek’s vocabulary and modular head design.
